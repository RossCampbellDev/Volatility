# R2D2 Malware
from https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility/wiki/Memory-Samples

## pslist/psxview/pstree
noticed that several VMWare processes are running
reader_sl is present, though probably not of interest this time!
cmd.exe running
checked through process-parent relationships to see who was started by whom

## netscan/connections/sockets
netscan/connections both show nothing
sockets shows a bunch of stuff
port 1026 potentially interesting as used by trojans (according to speedguide.net) as well as remote procedure calls
port 1029, even worse report
port 445 on SYSTEM process apparently a big potential vulnerability
basically all ports mentioned in the sockets results seem dubious, with 445 and 1029 seeming worst
System and an svchost instance

## cmdline
trying this module on various processes, i noticed that winlogon.exe does not originate from \Windows\System32 as expected
winlogon.exe was also started by csrss.exe - when it's not supposed to have a parent process

## procdump
tested a few processes by dumping them and uploading to virustotal
several of my processes-of-interest returned red flags, but only a few each

## consoles
running the consoles module on the dump, i saw something interesting
in the csrss.exe process, "titled" as %SystemRoot%\system32\cmd.exe" ran 2 commands
1 typo, followed by "sc query malware".  SEEMS LEGIT.
"SERVICE_NAME: malware
TYPE :1 KERNEL_DRIVER

attached process 544, who's that? - oh wait i noted this earlier.  the cmd.exe process
handle 0x4c4

## handles
grepped the output to find process 608 (csrss) started cmd.exe
process 688 (lsass) recorded an event "PS_SERVICE_STARTED"
a key?  USER\S-1-5-21-839522115-73586283-2147125571-500_CLASSES.  what's that?

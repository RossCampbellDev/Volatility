# R2D2 Malware
from https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility/wiki/Memory-Samples

## pslist/psxview/pstree
noticed that several VMWare processes are running
reader_sl is present, though probably not of interest this time!
cmd.exe running
checked through process-parent relationships to see who was started by whom

## netscan/connections/sockets
netscan/connections both show nothing
sockets shows a bunch of stuff
port 1026 potentially interesting as used by trojans (according to speedguide.net) as well as remote procedure calls
port 1029, even worse report
port 445 on SYSTEM process apparently a big potential vulnerability
basically all ports mentioned in the sockets results seem dubious, with 445 and 1029 seeming worst
System and an svchost instance

## cmdline
trying this module on various processes, i noticed that winlogon.exe does not originate from \Windows\System32 as expected
winlogon.exe was also started by csrss.exe - when it's not supposed to have a parent process

## procdump
tested a few processes by dumping them and uploading to virustotal
several of my processes-of-interest returned red flags, but only a few each

## consoles
running the consoles module on the dump, i saw something interesting
in the csrss.exe process, "titled" as %SystemRoot%\system32\cmd.exe" ran 2 commands
1 typo, followed by "sc query malware".  SEEMS LEGIT.
"SERVICE_NAME: malware
TYPE :1 KERNEL_DRIVER

attached process 544, who's that? - oh wait i noted this earlier.  the cmd.exe process
handle 0x4c4

## handles
grepped the output to find process 608 (csrss) started cmd.exe
process 688 (lsass) recorded an event "PS_SERVICE_STARTED"
a key?  USER\S-1-5-21-839522115-73586283-2147125571-500_CLASSES.  what's that?

# checking someone's guide
## connscan
shows active connections - hadn't heard of this.
shows a connection from process 1956, local port 1026 to external 6666

at this point i stop following
procdump 1956, upload to virustotal.  LOTS of red flags.

## strings
grepped the contents of the explorer.exe process dump looking for the controller IP address found with connscan, didn't find much

# conclusion
explorer.exe would appear to be the malicious process
it's communicating out to what is presumably a remote controller
this process initiated several VMware processes as well as the cmd.exe process - and reader_sl.exe, though it seems clean
a search tells me that R2D2 is ransomware, perhaps this is why the VMware processes exist - or perhaps they were simply created by whoever made the memory dump
